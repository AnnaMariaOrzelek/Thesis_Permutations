# Thesis_Permutations

Final thesis and RCodes for "Exploring the role of permutations in the detection of errors and anomalies in statistical analysis".

The repository contains:
- a pdf file "Thesis_Orzelek" with the final thesis
- four RCode files to reproduce the results of the thesis. Further explanations are given in the files.
- the HapMap data as used in the RCode, prepared and processed by Boulesteix, A. L., Bender, A., Lorenzo Bermejo, J., & Strobl, C. (2012) in "Random forest Gini importance favours SNPs with large minor allele frequency: impact, sources and recommendations.". The link to their data and code can also be found in the paper.
